There's a problem with the Addon System which limits us from making the addon system better. For some stupid reason, we cannot load the configuration due to `sm.storage` being mod dependent but that's a fine sacrifice.

Another problem (which is the biggest) is that **we couldn't figure out a method to synchronize a variable between 2 mods**. If we found out then the API for the Addon System would be a LOT larger.

We would be happy if anyone could solve our biggest issue with the addon system. At the time we don't know what we can give something back from you if you were to find a solution.
